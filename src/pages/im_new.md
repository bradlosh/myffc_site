## Welcome Home! ##

![pfj](../../assets/images/pfj.jpg "Pastor Frank & Judi Jones")
Welcome to Faith Family Church!  We hope when you walk through the doors
you will immediately recognize that you are among friends--a diverse,
wonderful group of people who love Jesus and who are committed to
helping you discover yourself in the light of the Word of God.  We have
been praying for you, and no matter your background or life experience,
you'll find a place where you're warmly welcomed and feel right at home! - *Pastor Frank & Judi Jones*


## Our Mission ##

...is to equip and strengthen the Body of Christ to carry on the work of Jesus...

**The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because He hath anointed me to
preach the gospel to the poor;  He hath sent to heal the brokenhearted,
to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the
blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, to preach the acceptable
year of the Lord.** Luke 4:18-19
 

## What Should You Expect? ##

Probably not “church as usual," you and your family can expect a
genuine, refreshing and fun experience with the Lord.  Here are a few
things you might want to know:

-   What is a Sunday service like?
-   What is a Wednesday evening service like?
-   What do we believe?
-   Take the 12-Week Challenge


### What Is A Sunday Service Like? ###

Sunday mornings are a great time to experience FFC for the first time.
Our services are fun, relevant and loaded with worship, the Word and the
power of the Spirit.  You will see diversity in our dress -- coats &
ties to blue jeans & tee shirts. We believe God is most interested in
your heart!  Preschool- and elementary-aged children are dismissed after
music ministry to attend classes where the Bible is presented on their
own level.  Nursery is available for the entire service.

### What Is A Wednesday Evening Service Like? ###

On Wednesday evenings, the adults meet in the Fellowship Hall (enter the
left side—fire station side--of the building) for a casual Bible study,
where you are free to enjoy a cup of coffee & ask questions. Also
meeting during the Wednesday night service, Encounter Youth (grades
6-12) and Planet Faith Kids Choir (grades 1-5). Nursery is available.

### What Do We Believe? ###

We are committed to teach the Word of God in a way that shows you how to
apply His Truth to your everyday life. We desire to provide an
atmosphere where people from all walks of life can come together,
worship God, and in His presence encounter the One who has the ability
to change us all into the best we can be.

[Statement of Faith](../believe/ "We Believe…")

### Take The 12-Week Challenge ###

It's hard to judge a church by attending only one service, so we've got
a challenge for you. Come each week for 12 weeks, and if you don't see
marked improvements in your daily and spiritual life, perhaps we're not
the church for you; but if you do see a change, then keep on coming
because that's just the beginning of all God has for you! We are
confident in God's ability to transform your life.
