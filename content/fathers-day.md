Hello Friends,

This Sunday is Father's day! Father's day does not compare to Mother's
day in the number of cards mailed, flowers sent, dinners bought, phone
calls made, money spent or any other way you want to compare the two
days.

It is always amazing to me how over-sized football players being
interviewed after some great feat on the field often respond, *"Hi Mom"*
into the camera*.* It is not that they don't love or appreciate Dad.
Dad's program after a son is born is to raise a man. To mom, he may be
six foot five and weight over 300 lbs but he is still her baby and
always will be.

**Eph 6:2-3 KJV**  
<i>2 Honour thy father and mother; (which is the first commandment with
promise;)  
3 That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the
earth.

</i>Don't forget to at least call dad Sunday and let him know how much
you appreciate him!

In His Love,

Pastors Frank and Judi
