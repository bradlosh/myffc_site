<span style="font-family:Arial;">Hello Friends,

**3 John 2** *Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper
and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.  
*  
Our prosperity and health depends on the prosperity of our soul!

**Prov 4:20-22**  
<i> 20 My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings.  
21 Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of thine
heart.  
22 For they are life unto those that find them, and health to all their
flesh.

</i>The prosperity of our soul depends on "*attending to his Word."  
* Attending to His Word leads to the health of our flesh!

Looking forward to seeing you Sunday as we attend to His Word!

In His love,

Pastors Frank and Judi
