<span style="font-family:Arial;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">Hello
Friends,

I was watching an old cowboy years ago. There was a cowboy wanting to
marry a beautiful young daughter of a local rancher. Upon asking the
father for her hand the father asked if the cowboy was a regular church
going man. He immediately responded that he was. He always went to
church on Christmas and Easter. That was whenever he was near one. For
many people that is what regular church going is.

Paul said in **Heb 10:24-25**:  
*24 And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good
works:  
25 Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of
some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the
day approaching.  
*  
Consider yourself provoked! <span class="moz-smiley-s1"><span>
