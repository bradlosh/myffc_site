Hello Friends,

Judi and I pray for you almost everyday. Today our prayer is not a very
long one:

"<em>May you prosper and be in health even as you prosper in your
understanding of God and His Word!" (3 Jn 2)

</em>In His Love,

Pastors Frank and Judi

P.S. Don't forget breakfast Sunday. Looking forward to seeing you in the
fellowship hall for breakfast at 9:30.
