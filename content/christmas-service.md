Hello Friends,

Don't forget our Sunday Christmas service will be at 2 P.M. It is a
special service and we all look forward to a great blessing. What better
could we do on Christmas day than be in the God's house worshiping Him.
Looking forward to seeing you there!

Merry Christmas and may 2012 be your best year yet!

In His Love,

Pastors Frank and Judi
