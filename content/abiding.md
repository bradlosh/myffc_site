<span>Hello Friends,

You cannot have faith without abiding in the source of faith.  
Scripture is called the Word of Faith  
Jesus is called the Living Faith.  
We need the book but </span><span>We must go from a book of faith to a
person of faith.

**John 15:4-5** </span>**<span>KJV</span>**  
<span><span> *4 Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear
fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye
abide in me.  
5 I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in
him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do
nothing.  
*</span>  
What have you been abiding in this week?

Looking for you in church tomorrow!
