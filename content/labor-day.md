    Hello Friends,

    It seems the world is in constant turmoil. If it is not earth quakes, its hurricanes, if not hurricanes if is tornadoes, if not tornadoes, drought, if not drought flooding, if not flooding, wild fires.  People are in a state of unrest. They are casting off governments believing the unknown has to be better than the known. There seems to be wars and rumors of wars all around the globe. The  world economic system is in a state of flux. Where is a person to turn for rest and security in such troubling times?

    Matt 11:28-30 KJV
     28 Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
     29 Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.
     30 For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.

    If the circumstances of this life are over-burdening you, then maybe you are spending to much time listening to the news and not enough time in the Good News!

    Have a great Labor Day break!

    In His Love,

    Pastor Frank and Judi
