In this wonderful season of love I want you to know that you are more
loved by God than any one person could ever try and express. His love is
eternal and will never fade away through anger, frustration or
disappointment. He has a love that never fails and will always win out
every time it is allowed into your life. His love is the greatest
expression that we could ever see and experience. He gave His only Son
so that we might have eternal life through Him and His expressed
sacrifice on the cross. Receive this tangible expression of His love for
you today and receive His best gift ever. He loves you and so do we at
Faith Family Church.

 

Regards,
