Hello Friends,

We will continue answering three questions this Sunday morning:  
What is a covenant or testament? (Two words used interchangeable)  
Why the importance of blood?  
Why was the shedding of Jesus’ blood necessary?

**Heb 8:6-7 KJV**  
***    6 But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how
much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established
upon better promises.***  
**    *7 For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no
place have been sought for the second.***

Jesus is the mediator of a better covenant in what way? In every way!

Join us Sunday morning as we study the benefits of our better covenant!

In His Love,

Pastors Frank and Judi
