<span style="font-family:Arial;">Hello Friends,

</span><span style="font-family:Arial;">**Psalms
118:24**</span><span style="font-family:Arial;"> <i>reads: This is a day
the Lord has made; I will rejoice and be glad in it.

</i>Beginning this Sunday you can start your rejoicing an hour earlier.
It is Spring forward time.  
Don't forget to turn your clocks forward one hour before you go to
bed.  
Also don't forget it is breakfast Sunday. Join us in the fellowship
hall for breakfast and a time of fellowship.  
We will give name tags to everyone so you can learn names of people you
don't know.

In His Love,

Pastors Frank and Judi
