Hello Friends,

What a wonderful day! The Christian Family calls today *Good Friday*.
When I was a young lad I asked our Pastor at the time why it was
called *Good Friday* when it was the day our Lord was crucified. Thank
God, Now I know and I hope you do too. My sin for his righteousness, my
sickness for His health, my poverty for his wealth. That my friends is
the *great exchange* and that is why it is **Good Friday**!

In His Love,

Pastors Frank and Judi
