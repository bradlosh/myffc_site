<span style="font-family:Arial;">Hello Friends,

People have been robbed of the faith that they did have by other people,
some well meaning people twisting the Word of God.

**2 Tim 2:15** reads in this manner:  
*Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to
be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.  
*  
We serve a healing God. His will is to heal everyone, every time but it
is sad to say that God's will is not always carried out on this earth
and we often turn and blame Him.

Join us Sunday morning as we look at the very scriptures that people
would use to tell you it is not God's will to heal  
and let's allow the Word to determine our beliefs!

In His Love
