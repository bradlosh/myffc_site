Hello Friends,

Brad, Judi, and I have just returned with our youth from a week of youth
camp. We were very blessed to be a part of this youth experience. I
truly believe it was one of the best if not the best youth camp I
personally have ever experienced. The overriding thought was the time
for games and playing church is over. It is time to make spiritual
things more important than natural.

What a blessing to see the fire of God upon the youth! Make sure and be
with us tomorrow, believing God that the same fire that they caught will
also ignite your soul.

Phil 3:14 *I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of
God in Christ Jesus.* KJV
