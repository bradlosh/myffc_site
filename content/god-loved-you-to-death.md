Hello,

The greatest love story known to mankind is Gods love for us. He loved
us before we loved Him. He pursued us and sought us out to make sure we
would see His love in demonstration towards us.

He knew we had broken the law and deserved a penalty of eternal death so
He loved us so much that He sent His only Son to take our place and pay
the price for our ticket of sin.

He loved us so much that He allowed His Son, Jesus Christ, to die
instead of us. He than raised Him from the dead so He could never die
again, securing to us an eternal redemption once we accept His Sacrifice
on the Cross of Calvary.

He loved us to death so He could also love us to Life!

Always remember that you have been bought and paid for through the
greatest act of Love known to mankind!

Remember that God loves you and so do we! Church services are Sunday
10:30 and Wednesday 7 PM. We look forward to seeing you there!

God Bless You!

Respectfully,

Pastors Frank and Judi
