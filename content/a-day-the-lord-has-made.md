Hello Friends,

Every day is a day the Lord has made. He spoke it into existence when he
spoke the rest of creation into existence. He intended the day to be a
blessing to you. Embrace each and every day as a gift of God. See it as
a new opportunity to accomplish what you were unable to accomplish
yesterday. Another opportunity for you to manifest the blessing of God!

**Ps 118:23-24 KJV**  
*23 This is the Lord's doing; it is marvellous in our eyes.  
24 This is the day which the Lord hath made; we will rejoice and be
glad in it.  
*  
Have a *marvellous *day!
