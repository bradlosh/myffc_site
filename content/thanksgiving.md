Hello Friends,

What an exciting time to be alive. This is your time. You were born for
such a time as this!

2 Cor 9:10-11

*10 Now he who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will also
supply and increase your store of seed and will enlarge the harvest of
your righteousness.*  
*11 You will be made rich in every way so that you can be generous on
every occasion, and through us your generosity will result in
thanksgiving to God.*  
NIV

Others are going to give thanks to God because you know Him!

Happy Thanks Giving,

Pastors Frank and Judi
