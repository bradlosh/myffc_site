Hello Friends,

We are going to have a random check up this week.

**Phil 4:8**  
*Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are
honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure,
whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if
there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, **think on these
things.***

How are you measuring up? If the peace of God is not ruling in your
mind, this is a good place to begin.

In His Love,

Pastors Frank and Judi
