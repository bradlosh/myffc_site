Hello Friends,

We are constantly in a spiritual battle. Satan desires to stop us from
operating in faith. Because we really are often *ignorant of his
devices*, we cooperate with him in functioning in weak or no faith at
all. He is a defeated foe and we become our own worst enemy. Sunday we
will begin looking at the *persevering Christian*. The one who
overcomes.

**I John 5:4-5**  
*...This is the victory that has overcome the world, even our faith*.

Will you be an over-comer?
