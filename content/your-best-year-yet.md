<span style="font-family:Arial;">Hello Friends,

We trust that you have </span><span
style="font-family:Arial;">found</span><span style="font-family:Arial;">
the first weeks of January to be the seed for 2011 becoming your best
year yet! You might ask on what evidence or what facts we base this
belief on? It comes straight from the mouth of Jesus Himself!

**Matt 17:20**  
*And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say
unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto
this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and<u>
nothing shall be impossible unto you.</u>*

If the world can sing, *"gloom, despair, and agony on me,"* how much
more should the body of Christ sing of our victory!

**John 16:33**  
<i>These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace.
In the world ye shall have tribulation: but <u>be of good cheer; I have
overcome the world.

</u></i>In His Love,

Pastors Frank and Judi
