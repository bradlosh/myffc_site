<span style="font-family:Arial;">Hello Friends,

We receive a stern warning from our Lord in the book of Matthew:

**Matt 24:37-39** </span>**<span
style="font-family:Arial;">KJV</span>**  
<span style="font-family:Arial;"> *37 But as the days of Noe were, so
shall also the coming of the Son of man be.  
38 For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and
drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe
entered into the ark,  
39 And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall
also the coming of the Son of man be.  
*  
Have you ever been driving down the road and someone with you asks,
*"Did you see that person (or animal) standing in the edge of the
road?"  
* and you have to admit that you didn't see anything? It is scary to
realize how close we might come to running over something and never
having seen it at all because our concentration was on steering the
automobile.

Jesus warns us not to get so busy with the daily routine of life that we
miss the Author of Life, Himself!

We look forward to gathering with you in church Sunday to rekindle the
flame and keep it burning brightly!

In His service,

Pastors Frank and Judi
