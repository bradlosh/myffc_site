Hello Friends,

This is an awesome time in which to live. The 91st Psalm records that a  
thousand will fall at our side, ten thousand at our right hand, The  
spiritual battle that we endure daily would be overpowering to our
flesh  
if we did not feed our spirit on a regular basis. So often people will  
pull a lone scripture out of the Bible and camp around it. The Word is  
not meant to be separated but to be digested as a whole. A Word that
you  
read in the past is not enough to hold you strong in these times in  
which we live.

Paul instructs us to be filled with the Spirit. The Amplified Bible  
tells us to *"ever be filled."* It is an ongoing process because
through  
daily struggles, we leak off. We must make it our purpose to stay
filled!

***Eph 5:18 AMP***  
*And do not get drunk with wine, for that is debauchery; but ever  
be filled and stimulated with the \[Holy\] Spirit.*

In His Love,

Pastors Frank and Judi

PS Don't forget Sunday is breakfast Sunday. Bring something for
yourself  
and someone else and we will look forward to seeing you there!
