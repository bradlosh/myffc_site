Hello Friends,

**James 1:21**  
<i> Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness,
and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your
souls.

</i>Two things we are instructed to do in this verse, *separate*
ourselves from filthiness and the overflow of wickedness and to
*receive* the engrafted or implanted Word and thereby saving our soul
(our mind, will and emotions). The Father has saved our spirits but left
our souls up to us. It is a process that requires time and the
encouragement of other Christians. Hang in there don't give up! The only
way Satan can defeat you is for you to give up and quit.
