<span style="font-family: Arial;">Hello Friends,</span>

It is amazing how the world wants to secularize everything. They are on
a constant campaign to remove God and His Word from the lives of people.
I think everyone is familiar with the homosexual lobby. I received an
email this week stating that a directive had gone out to all military
Chaplains to start preforming same sex marriages. Thank God some of the
Chaplains are rebelling.

If you don't believe in God, what makes same sex marriages wrong? If you
don't have God's Word as a foundation  for right and wrong, what makes
anything right or wrong if someone chooses to do it? Already polygamy
and pedophilia are being pushed as just another way of life. They say
people were born that way and can't help the way they are.

Our belief is that polygamy, pedophilia, and many other things are wrong
based on the truth of God's Word. The children of Israel needed the law
to show them right from wrong. Today we are sanctified through the truth
of God's Word.

**John 17:17 <span style="font-family: Arial;">KJV</span>**  
<span style="font-family: Arial;">*    Sanctify them through thy truth:
thy word is truth.  
*  
Without the truth of God's Word there is no sanctification and the
world will go adrift in their own foolishness.  The blind leading the
blind and according to His Truth, they both fall in a ditch.</span>

In His Love,

Pastors Frank and Judi
