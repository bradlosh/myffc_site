Hello Friends,

We want to encourage each of you to be in prayer for the upcoming
elections.

There never has been and never will be a nation that the entire populous
serves God. When Judi and I were in Israel several years ago, I was
astonished to find that the large majority of Jews are non-practicing
Jews when it comes to faith.They are living Bible prophecy simply by the
fact that they have returned to the Jewish homeland, yet are not
worshipers of God.

Even though the entire populous will of any nation will never serve God,
there has always been a remnant who does. Elijah thought he was the only
one yet God said He had reserved 7000 (a remnant) who had not bowed to
idol worship.

Everyone does not have to pray. All do not have to believe! We just need
the church to be the church and pray!

**2 Chron 7:14 KJV**  
*If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves,
and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I
hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.*

In His Love,

Pastors Frank and Judi
