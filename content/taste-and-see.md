<span style="font-family:Arial;">Hello Friends,

The Word says to, <i>"Taste and see that the Lord is good and His mercy
endureth forever."

</i>The Lord is good, always, at all times, in all circumstances. When
negative or bad things happen, He did not cause them and He is still
Good!  
You don't <i>"taste and see that the Lord is sometimes good and
sometimes bad."

</i>Don't forget tomorrow is the youth and children's yard sell to raise
money for camp! Join us at least for a good, fresh hot dog and some
wonderful fellowship! Looking forward to seeing you there!

Pastor's Frank and Judi
