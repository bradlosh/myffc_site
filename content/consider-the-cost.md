Hello Friends,

Jesus gave us instructions to consider the cost:  
**Luke 14:27-28**  
*27 And whosoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me, cannot be
my disciple.*  
*28 For which of you, intending to build a tower , sitteth not down
first, and counteth the cost, whether he have sufficient to finish it?*

Jesus is not talking about actually building a tower. He is talking
about our Christian walk. Jesus actually bought and paid for everything
we need to run our race to its completion. So the question is actually
are we willing to pay the price? It is so easy to put importance on
everything except the things of God.

Paul put it in this manner:  
**1 Cor 9:27**  
*But I keep under my body , and bring it into subjection: lest that by
any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be
aÂ castaway.*

*Strive*, exert great effort for the mark of the high calling, so when
your race is done, you will have nothing to be ashamed of!

In His Love,
