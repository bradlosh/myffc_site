<span style="font-family: Arial;">Hello Friends,

This Saturday night you need to set your alarm to get up at 2 AM Sunday
morning so you can turn your clocks back one hour. Of course you could
turn your clocks back before you go to bed and it would still work out
the same.The object is for us to have an extra hour in the day. (Only
government can add an hour to the day and still only have 24. Go figure
that one)

Regardless of when you turn your clock back, we are looking forward to
seeing you in church Sunday!

**Rom 13:11 **</span>**<span style="font-family: Arial;">KJV</span>**  
<span style="font-family: Arial;">*And that, knowing the **time**, that
now it is high **time **to awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation
nearer than when we believed.*

Pastors Frank and Judi
