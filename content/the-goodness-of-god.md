<span style="font-family: Arial;">Hello Friends,  
<small><small><small> </small></small></small>  
Sometimes it is difficult to believe just how good God really is!  
<small><small> </small></small>  
**Rom 2:4**</span>**<span style="font-family: Arial;">NKJV</span>**  
<span style="font-family: Arial;">*Or do you despise the riches of His
goodness, forbearance, and longsuffering, not knowing that the goodness
of God leads you to repentance?  
* <small><small><small> </small></small></small>  
It is the goodness of God that leads us into the great exchange.  
<small><small> </small></small>  
**2 Cor 5:21**</span>**<span style="font-family: Arial;">NKJV</span>**  
<span style="font-family: Arial;">*For He made Him who knew no sin to
be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.  
<small><small> </small></small>  
* And again it is recorded in Paul's letter to the Corinthian church,*  
* <small><small> </small></small>  
**2 Cor 8:9**</span>**<span style="font-family: Arial;">NKJV</span>**  
<span style="font-family: Arial;"><em>For you know the grace of our
Lord Jesus Christ, that though He was rich, yet for your sakes He became
poor, that you through His poverty might become rich.

</em>Jesus took our place that we might assume HIs.*  
* <small><small> </small></small>  
God is Good! All the time!  
<small><small> </small></small>  
Don't forget we have evening worship tonight at 6 P.M. <span
