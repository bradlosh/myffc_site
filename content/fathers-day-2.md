Hello Friends,

This Sunday is Father's Day. If your father is still abiding here on
earth make sure to let him know that you love and appreciate him.
Whether he is or not, your heavenly Father is alive and well. Make sure
you let Him know how thankful you are, if for no other reason, just to
be a part of His family!

**Gen 18:19 KJV**  
<em>For I know him, that he will command his children and his household
after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord, to do justice and
judgment;

</em>In His Love,

Pastors Frank and Judi
